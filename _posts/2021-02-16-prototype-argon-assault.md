Argon Assault is a game prototype I built while following along with GameDevTVâ€™s [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move left, right, up, and down
- Avoid hitting obstacles and terrain
- Shoot enemies to score points
