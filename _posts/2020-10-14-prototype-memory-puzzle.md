Memory Puzzle is a game prototype I built while following along with Awesome Tutsâ€™ [Unity Memory Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaCjBh7bWz0&list=PLZhNP5qJ2IA2DA4bzDyxFMs8yogVQSrjW&index=1) tutorial series on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Click two cards from the face down grid
- Memorize the two cards
- Cards automatically face down again
- Pair identical cards using as few turns as possible
