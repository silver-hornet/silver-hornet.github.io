[![Number Wizard]({{site.url}}/number-wizard.gif)]

Number Wizard is a game prototype I built while following along with GameDevTV’s [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Think of a number between 1 and 1000
- Respond to computer’s guess

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/gamedevtv-s-number-wizard).
