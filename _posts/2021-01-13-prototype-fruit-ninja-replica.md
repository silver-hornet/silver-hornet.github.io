Fruit Ninja Replica is a game prototype I built while following along with Brackeysâ€™ [How to make Fruit Slicing in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5_8sE18tQ&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5RwVEjFCiN5BvK3Quqgv_M&index=11) tutorial on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Slice as many watermelons as you can
