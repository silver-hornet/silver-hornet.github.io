![Zombie Runner]({{site.url}}/zombie-runner.gif)

Zombie Runner is a game prototype I built while following along with GameDevTVâ€™s [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move and jump
- Recharge your flash light battery
- Collect ammo
- Cycle between your weapons
- Shoot zombies
