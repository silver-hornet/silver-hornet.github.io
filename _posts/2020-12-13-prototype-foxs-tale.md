[![Fox’s Tale]({{site.url}}/foxs-tale.gif)]


Fox’s Tale is a game prototype (basically a mini-game this time) I built while following along with James Doyle’s [Learn To Code By Making a 2D Platformer in Unity & C#](https://www.udemy.com/course/unityplatformer/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move, jump, and double jump
- Avoid or jump on enemies
- Get to the level exit
- Complete all levels and beat the final boss
- Collect all gems and beat level target times to get badges (optional)
