Blackjack is a game prototype I built while following along with Kurt Kaiser’s [How to Make a Game - Create Blackjack and Learn Unity Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbsvRhEyGkKfl4AY3uUkocO02Vg_mhI0-) tutorial series on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Deal cards
- Place bet
- Get as close to 21 as you can by hitting or standing
- Beat the dealer’s score
- Don’t run out of money
