[![Asteroids Replica]({{site.url}}/asteroids-replica.gif)]

This is my first solo game prototype without following a tutorial. My goal was to create a close replica of the original Asteroids game. The core gameplay loop is:

- Use thrust, rotate, and hyperspace to move around the screen
- Shoot and avoid asteroids
- Beat your high score

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/asteroids-replica).
