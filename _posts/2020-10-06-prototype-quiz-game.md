Quiz Game is a game prototype I built while following along with Brackeysâ€™ [How to make a Quiz Game in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_Ff1SPhidg&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR7ucA2yo5pjvKY0cJmNTq2L&index=1) tutorial series on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Read question
- Click True or False

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/brackeys-quiz-game).
