Project Boost is a game prototype I built while following along with GameDevTVâ€™s [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Use thrust and rotate to fly your rocket to the landing pad
- Avoid hitting terrain and obstacles

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/gamedevtv-s-project-boost).
