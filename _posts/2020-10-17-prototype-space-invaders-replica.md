Space Invaders Replica is a game prototype I built while following along with Stephen Barrâ€™s [Making Space Invaders with Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnfwNzpoIlA) tutorial on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move left and right
- Protect all your shields from being destroyed
- Shoot enemies
- Avoid being hit by enemies or their lasers
