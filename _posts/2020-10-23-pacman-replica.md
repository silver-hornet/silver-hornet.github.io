PacMan Replica is a game prototype I built while following along with Noob Tutsâ€™ [Unity 2D PacMan Tutorial](https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pacman-game) on [Noob Tuts](https://www.noobtuts.com/). The core gameplay loop is:

- Move around
- Avoid colliding with ghosts
- Collect all pellets to complete level

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/pacman-replica-from-noob-tuts-unity-2d-pac-man-tutorial).
