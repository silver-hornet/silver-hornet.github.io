Bubble Struggle Replica is a game prototype I built while following along with Brackeyâ€™s [How to make a Bubble Struggle replica in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jGVesn7O4g&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5RwVEjFCiN5BvK3Quqgv_M&index=5&t=0s) tutorial on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move left and right
- Avoid the balls
- Shoot all the balls
