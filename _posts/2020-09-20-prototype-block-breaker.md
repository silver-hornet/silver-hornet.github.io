Block Breaker is a game prototype I built while following along with GameDevTV’s [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Launch ball from paddle
- Hit blocks with ball
- Don’t let the ball pass by paddle
- Hit all blocks on screen to complete the level

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/gamedevtv-s-block-breaker).
