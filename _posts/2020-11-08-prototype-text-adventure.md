Text Adventure is a game prototype I built while following along with Unityâ€™s [Text Adventure Game](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/live-session-making-a-flappy-bird-style-game) tutorial series on Unity Learn Premium. The core gameplay loop is:

- Read text
- Interact with room and objects by typing go, examine, take, use, or inventory
- Escape the dungeon

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/unity-learn-premium-s-text-adventure).
