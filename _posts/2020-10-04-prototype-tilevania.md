TileVania is a game prototype I built while following along with GameDevTVâ€™s [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move around the screen
- Get to the level exit
- Avoid enemies, spikes, and water

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/gamedevtv-s-tilevania).
