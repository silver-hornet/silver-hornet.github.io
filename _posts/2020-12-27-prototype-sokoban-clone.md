Tic Tac Toe is a game prototype I built while following along with Platoevolvedâ€™s [Box Pusher - Create a Sokoban Clone in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESh8phnmiXg) tutorial on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move up, down, left, or right
- Push boxes onto green points
- Level ends once all boxes are on green points

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/platoevolved-s-sokoban-clone).
