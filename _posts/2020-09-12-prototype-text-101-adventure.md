[![Text 101 Adventure]({{site.url}}/text-101-adventure.gif)]

Text 101 Adventure is a game prototype I built while following along with GameDevTVâ€™s [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Read text
- Make a choice
