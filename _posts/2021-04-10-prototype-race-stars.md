![James Doyle’s Race Stars]({{site.url}}/race-stars.gif)

Race Stars is a game prototype (basically a mini-game this time) I built while following along with James Doyle’s [Learn To Create A Racing Game With Unity & C#](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-racer/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Drive your car around the race track
- Finish the race in 1st place to unlock the next track

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/james-doyle-s-race-stars).
