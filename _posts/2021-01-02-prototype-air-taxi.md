[![Air Taxi]({{site.url}}/air-taxi.gif)]

My own prototype of an air taxi game. The core gameplay loop is:

- Fly up, left, and right
- Pick up passenger
- Deliver passenger to their selected destination
- Deliver all passengers to win the game

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/air-taxi).
