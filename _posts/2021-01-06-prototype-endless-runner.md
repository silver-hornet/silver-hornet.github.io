![Endless Runner]({{site.url}}/endless-runner.gif)

Endless Runner is a game prototype I built while following along with Blackthornprodâ€™s [How to make a simple game in Unity - Endless Runner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M7vX_z6B9I) tutorial series on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move up and down
- Avoid enemies
