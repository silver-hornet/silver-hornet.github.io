[![Pong Replica]({{site.url}}/pong-replica.png)](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/tetris-replica-from-noob-tuts-unity-2d-pong-game-tutorial)

Pong Replica is a game prototype I built while following along with Noob Tuts’ [Unity 2D Pong Tutorial](https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pong-game) on [Noob Tuts](https://www.noobtuts.com/). The core gameplay loop is:

- Hit ball with paddle
- Don’t let ball pass your paddle
- Get the ball past your opponent

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/tetris-replica-from-noob-tuts-unity-2d-pong-game-tutorial).
