Tic Tac Toe is a game prototype I built while following along with UY Studiosâ€™ [How To Make 2D Tic Tac Toe Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBamzpJTlG4&list=PLkzh1bySTmYB83ybePBUtsP4t0DAdspiw) tutorial series on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Choose X or O
- Take turns trying to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of 3 Xs or 3 Os
- Complete the line before your opponent completes theirs
