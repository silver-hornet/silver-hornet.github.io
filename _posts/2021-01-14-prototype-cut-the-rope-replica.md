Cut the Rope Replica is a game prototype I built while following along with Brackeysâ€™ [How to make a Cut the Rope Replica in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx3jb4muLjQ&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5RwVEjFCiN5BvK3Quqgv_M&index=10) tutorial on YouTube. The core gameplay loop is:

- Cut the ropes
- Get the ball into the bucket
