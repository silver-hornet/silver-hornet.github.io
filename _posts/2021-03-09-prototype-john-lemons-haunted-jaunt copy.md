John Lemon’s Haunted Jaunt is a game prototype I built while following along with Unity’s [John Lemon’s Haunted Jaunt 3D Beginner](https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner) course on Unity Learn Premium. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move John Lemon around the environment to find the exit
- Avoid being caught by ghosts and gargoyles

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-12).
