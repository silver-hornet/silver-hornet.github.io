![Wilmer Lin’s Match-Three]({{site.url}}/match-three.gif)

Match-Three is a game prototype I built while following along with Wilmer Lin’s [Make a Match-Three Puzzle Game in Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/make-a-puzzle-match-game-in-unity/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Move game pieces
- Create matches of three or more of the same color
- Meet the score target before you run out of moves

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/wilmer-lin-s-match-three).
