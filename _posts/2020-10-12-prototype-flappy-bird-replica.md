Flappy Bird Replica is a game prototype I built while following along with Unityâ€™s [Making a Flappy Bird Style Game](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/live-session-making-a-flappy-bird-style-game) tutorial series on Unity Learn Premium. The core gameplay loop is:

- Flap wings to stay in the air
- Avoid hitting obstacles
- Get high score

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/flappy-bird-replica-from-unity-s-making-a-flappy-bird-style-game-tutorial).
