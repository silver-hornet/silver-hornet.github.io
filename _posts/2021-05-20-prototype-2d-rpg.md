![James Doyle’s 2D RPG]({{site.url}}/2d-rpg.gif)

Yet Another 2D RPG Game is a game prototype (basically a mini-game this time) I built while following along with James Doyle’s [Learn To Create An RPG Game In Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity2drpg/) course on Udemy. This is my first prototype that actually contains a story and dialogue.

The core gameplay loop is:

- Explore the environment
- Click on objects to interact with them and open dialogue
- Collect health and mana potions and use them to upgrade your stats
- Battle the enemies using attacks and magic
- Complete the quest to save a family from the clutches of a dragon

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/james-doyle-s-2d-rpg).
