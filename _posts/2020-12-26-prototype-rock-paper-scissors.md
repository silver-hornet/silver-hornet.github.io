[![Rock Paper Scissors]({{site.url}}/rock-paper-scissors.gif)]

My own prototype of a basic Rock Paper Scissors game. The core gameplay loop is:

- Choose your throw (rock, paper, scissors) against the AI
- Winner is decided

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/rock-paper-scissors-4).
