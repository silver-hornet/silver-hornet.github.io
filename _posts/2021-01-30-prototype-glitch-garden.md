[![Glitch Garden]({{site.url}}/glitch-garden.gif)]

Glitch Garden is a game prototype I built while following along with GameDevTVâ€™s [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) course on Udemy. The core gameplay loop is:

- Use your resources to buy defenders (cactus, trophy, gnome, or tombstone)
- Place defenders to prevent attackers from reaching the left-side of the screen
- Stop enough defenders to progress to the next level

Play the game in your browser [here](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/glitch-garden-5).
