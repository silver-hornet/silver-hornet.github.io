My game dev journey started off with a realization: games have been a strong part of my life from a very young age, whether it was playing card and board games, or playing video games on various consoles and mobile devices. There are many platforms, titles, and genres I’ve enjoyed – and continue to enjoy – playing. I enjoy learning about the history of games, as well as learning about what it takes to make them.

While there have been periods of my life where other things have taken over for a while, I always gravitate back to games. So during the COVID-19 pandemic, I’ve been reflecting more on the things I really want to do in life. And making games keeps bubbling to the top. So it’s finally time to do something about that.

## How?

By setting two goals:

1. Build 40 prototypes within my first 12 months of learning game development using Unity and C#.
2. Work on this every day, even if it’s just 15 minutes. Constant repetition and immersion is the only way to make real progress and build momentum.

The 40 prototypes can be built while following along with tutorials. After my first 12 months, I might consider building a polished version of one of these prototypes (with more levels) or make an attempt at one of my own 150+ game ideas I’ve come up with over the years.

I started this initial 12-month daily game dev journey on June 29, 2020. This website will document my progress; showcasing my prototypes, and sharing some of the things I have learned along the way.
